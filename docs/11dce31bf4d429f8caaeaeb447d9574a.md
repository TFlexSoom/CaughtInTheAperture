Welcome To Capture the Aperature
================================

I was considering that myself. The setting will be in a Sci-Fi book that Vinny is reading to a younger nephew. The place is called "neo-manhatten" (based on neo-tokyo in Akira). This is a couple months after some legendary fights broke out amongst some "avatars." Since this fight, neo-manhatten has become slightly barren but still lively. People have started dividing themselves amongst several communities bordering a black hole like structure in the center of the city.

The group will be playing as characters asked to escort a baron's son to a nearby colony/community. The baron is lovesick and would like to pronounce his love to a family friend's daughter (typical rich people).

There will be some special rules like I was telling you about:
- Everyone will be given an additional can-trip, but using this cantrip will also have an poor (non-lethal) effect of my choice (it will be the same each time you use it).
- Special Items may be acquired in game which will change a characters alignment and drastically alter the possible ending
- Players will be given mini-games or impromptu scenes where inspiration will be granted. (I may add a secondary bonus effect to inspiration rather than just advantage on a roll)
- There will be fixed characters (like the baron's son) that cannot be changed in the timeline. AKA I reserve the right to Deus Ex Machina whatever I feel like if it would ruin the lore (like killing the baron's son)
