Special Rules
-------------

There will be some special rules like I was telling you about:
- Everyone will be given an additional can-trip, but using this cantrip will also have an poor (non-lethal) effect of my choice (it will be the same each time you use it).
- Special Items may be acquired in game which will change a characters alignment and drastically alter the possible ending
- Players will be given mini-games or impromptu scenes where inspiration will be granted. (I may add a secondary bonus effect to inspiration rather than just advantage on a roll)
- There will be fixed characters (like the baron's son) that cannot be changed in the timeline. AKA I reserve the right to Deus Ex Machina whatever I feel like if it would ruin the lore (like killing the baron's son)`
