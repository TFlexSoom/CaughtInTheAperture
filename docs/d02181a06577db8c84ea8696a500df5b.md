## About the Site
This website just represents me practicing with Webpack and ReactJS. I have been wanting to craft a world like this for a while. I think that this world represents a good template: something I am used to creating in software. I hope to iterate on it over and over again in the future. I do not expect this site to be popular in any way, but I am glad to be able to make this public. I really enjoyed conducting the idea together. I hope others find a way to enjoy it like me.


#### A Word on Licensing
I would like to retain copyright on this work, so most likely this will all be under an MIT license.
